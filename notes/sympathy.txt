complaining. complaining. everyone's complaining. complaining about what they did. he did. she did. they said. he said. she said. this is what i get as the group therapist, huh? i can't even speak over the sea of vices and whining. i don't even know how to say the words 'i'm sad' anymore without feeling sick like the others that just shove their emotion onto me. they burnt those sparklers in front of me even when i told them to stop. even when i saw their faces, those fires, burning and engulfing everything, they just dejectedly blew them out and looked at me like i was something to be pitied and something that ruined the mood. i saw melting faces like wax, i was back in that forest looking at the city burning in a massive fire. in that moment, i wondered, would my life ever be the same? should i just have walked into the fire like the rest? should i have spared myself the suffering, the pain that's gone nowhere? i don't know how to express myself. but maybe it's good-there's no point. nobody will see me hurting no matter how much i scream. nobody will ask how i am. nobody will bother returning the things i ask. fuck, not even a 'are you okay?' not even a 'how are you too?' why do i always have to be the one worried about how people feel? the slightest shifts in tone, the tired looks on peoples faces, but i pratically have to scream my way out of my shell just for people to keep complaining and complaining and complaining and complaining and complaining and complaining and complaining. they're all so wrapped up in their own heads they can't even get the concept of sympathy through their heads. i'm upset. i'm mad. i'm screaming, helping people that have stabbed me with their complacency and it makes me sick. i know nobody has any obligation to care for anyone but themselves, even if i do it. but is it really meant to be for nothing even after all this irony?

sympathy is dead.

and i'm clinging onto only desperation that i might be seen.
