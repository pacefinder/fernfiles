        You burst through the door, rushing up the stairs to get to the balcony. As you rushed up the stairs, you made sure the syringe given to you was tucked in your back pocket and also that it wouldn't stab you instead, knocking you out. What were you going to say? What could you say, that would bring the POI from the literal edge?
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Nearly out of breath, 8 floors up, you arrived at the balcony of the old apartment. The sun had already started to set, but as you looked at the edge of the darkness you saw the POI. Standing at the edge of the apartment.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Fern listlessly stared at you. "Oh. You found me. And the fact I don't know you probably means you're one of them."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        You were about to feign ignorance, but realize they probably knew. More than you, especially with all that censored text. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        You told Fern that this wasn't worth it. That they had more to live for.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "And what, so you guys can take me in?" Fern turned around, tears in their eyes. "I won't let you do that to me. I saw what those expirements did to people. You kidnapped people. Do you even know this? Did you know they were doing this?"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Do you have any, even the slighest idea what I've been through?" Fern was shaking, trembling as the orange light of the sky started to fade into a purple darkness. "I know that's selfish to say, but every day since that day-has been hell. I've been haunted, I've been around people that refuse to try to understand me, try, they could just try but-no, they don't even do that."
