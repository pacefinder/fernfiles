        In a couple days after this note is written, I will kill myself by going to building 425 and jumping off the balcony.
        <br>
        <br>
        My story should pop up on local news, just to ensure my death. Writing this now, it feels like I'm drawing a blank. It feels like I have so much more that I want to say, but I'm also at a loss for words.
        <br>
        <br>
        I trust my mom with all my things and what to do with them. I didn't have much, but I confided in her more than anything. My memories are yours to distribute, mom. I'm sorry for being so selfish, which is why I wanted to put you under foster care so you could be okay even when I was gone.
        <br>
        <br>
        I wanna say sorry to the people that would miss me, but that feels pointless when I'm at the stage where people missing me feels like nothing but faint memories. It feels egotistical to say people would miss me, so I won't talk about it.
        <br>
        <br>
        I hope the two people I'm talking about never see this note. The two people from that small, rural town that lived after that fire along with me. But if they do, I want to say I love you two. I never stopped, and it hurt so much being away from you two. Please take care. Please be okay. I love you. And I'm sorry.
