        "T-Things? Oh, like, uh, sleepovers and stuff?" Fern took some deep breaths, calming down as they were able to ground themselves in the conversation to take the situation off their mind. "What do you mean 'get how they work'? They don't have like, formal rules and stuff to them."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "I know that!" Leif grumbled, scratching the back of his head meekly. "I thought though, uh, there were like unspoken norms and things to them. Just-uh, I've never been to a sleepover before. And this means a lot to me. And I don't wanna do anything weird, or mess it up… So when I heard about like, often times people slept in the same bed during sleepovers I thought we could do that."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Leif…" Fern crossed their arms, frowning a bit as they felt a bit guilty for freaking out. It makes sense Leif never went on a sleepover considering his parents, and he seemed to be just as worried as Fern was. "Aw, c'mere!"        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "W-Woah!" Leif stumbled, falling down on his side along with Fern as they faced each other on the bed.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "You don't gotta worry about rules or anything here, it's alright! And sorry for, ah, freaking out earlier. It just really caught me off guard, haha…" Fern nervously chuckled. The sensation of Leif staring at them in their bed betrayed their words as they felt their face start to heat up. "You just seemed so confident but, ah, um… Are you kinda embarassed by this, too?"        <br>
