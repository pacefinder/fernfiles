        "You wanted to lie on the floor..?"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Yeah! You, my very esteemed guest, should sleep on the bed. I slept on the floor as a kid all the time, well, just because I could, not because I was getting punished-I was a really weird kid, okay? So I promise I won't mind." Fern scratched the back of their head, looking around awkwardly.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Well, I have a sleeping bag and everything, I brought one right here just so I could sleep on the floor-" Leif walked over to his bag, pulling out a sleeping bag. "And like, I sleep in a bed literally every day, too. I can sleep on the floor once."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "C'mon, I sleep in my bed every day. You should try it! And you need the sleep far more than I do."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "But-I don't wanna make you just sleep on the floor, I would feel too guilty! I already mentally prepared myself to sleep in the sleeping bag, y'know-"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "And that's why I'm saying, you can get a nice change of pace from what you expected by sleeping on a nice, cozy, comfortable bed!" Fern pouted, sitting on the bed and patting the spot next to them to invite Leif.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Leif stood there for a bit, thinking to himself.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "…Leif?"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "…Leif, I don't wanna stress you out, if you're worried I can let you sleep on the floor-"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Leif suddenly sat down next to Fern on the bed. "Well, if we can't make a decision, we may as well both get comfortable!"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Yeah-wait, what?"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>What?</i>
