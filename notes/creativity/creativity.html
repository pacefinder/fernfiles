        Fern raised their arms, falling onto the bed with a quiet thump as they sighed wistfully.  "Ahh, bed sweet bed… Volunteering at the fair was way more exhausting than I expected. Those volunteer hours are gonna be important though, I would rather get it over with now rather than later when I'm hurried."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "True, true. And hey, I think you seemed to be having some fun thankfully, even as tiring as it was…" Leif dropped off his backpack by Fern's door as he scanned around their room out of curiosity. The best way to describe it was a sort of 'creative storm', of sticky notes and papers that were either delayed schoolwork or unfinished creative projects. There were trinkets, a handful of small figures, and books on the shelves above their laptop. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Fern grinned. "Oh, for sure! I have to say it was way more fun with you, though. Remember that guy with the ironic alpha galaxy wolf shirt?"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Leif stifled a chuckle. "Pfft-yeah, I remember you literally pouncing for your phone to show me the image." 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Fern started putting some shirts away as they cleaned up the floor. "Sorry about the uh, mess, by the way. I swear I tried to clean up, but my brain was, uh, not braining yesterday. And also, thank you so, so much for helping out."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Of course! I should be thanking you for letting me stay over, I'm really grateful. Especially since my parents are away, and they would have rather just left the home locked. I don't think they felt safe leaving me home alone either, so I'm really really grateful." Leif started to fold up some clothes and tidied up alongside Fern, as they held up what seemed to be a random assignment. "Oh, where do you want this to go?"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Leif, you've told my mom you're grateful to the point that she thinks that you're trying to reach a world record of how many times someone says 'thank you' and 'grateful'. Relax a bit, it's alright! We're just as grateful to have you over, and I know I am, for sure." Fern chuckled, walkng over to squint at the paper Leif was holding. "Hm… You can just put that on the desk—wait, is that my english assignment?! I was looking for this thing yesterday, to the point I just gave up and had to print it, then redo the whole damn thng!"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Oh, god, and looking at this thing too you were already almost finished. I would be so annoyed, honestly." Leif nervously chuckled, picturing himself in the same situation. "I guess it's not bad we're cleaning up a bit now then! So hopefully you don't have to go through a hell like that again."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "I feel a bit more at peace after having found it. Some closure, you know?" Fern let out an exaggerated sigh as the both of them put away the last of the scattered items in their room. "…when did we just start cleaning my room?"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "I dunno, you started cleaning the things on the floor so maybe I don't step on them? Or just because it's the both of us?"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "No, no, I had a clear reason… Oh, yeah!" Fern's eyes lit up with realization. "I wanted to give you the bed and lie on the floor."
