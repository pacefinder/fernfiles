        "What?!" Leif's face went red instantly. "What do you mean-huh?!"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Come on! The two main characters are in bed together, you say something moving and touching, and we kiss!" Fern laughed, jokingly getting closer to Leif.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The two of them laughed, but as Leif's arm wrapped around Fern in the struggle Fern started to slow down.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Thank you, Leif. That really, really means so much to me." Fern pulled themselves just ever so slightly tighter to Leif. "I feel like, yeah, I have been kind of almost going against the world sometimes. Like the way things could be, like you said. But, I dunno, just being seen like that, in such a detailed way..."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "It was kinda embarassing, but in a good way. It made me feel seen. Thank you so much, Leif."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Of course. I wanna struggle with you, too. We can do this together. Just me and you against the world!" Leif chuckled at their own corny statement.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Fern moved their own arm to wrap around Leif. "Can we... stay like this for a bit?"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Mhm."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Nighty, Leif..."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Goodnight, Fern."
        <br>
