        Leif yawned, scooting to the other side of the bed and crossing his legs on the bed. "What do you mean, what? If we're struggling with who should sleep on the nice comfortable bed, why can't we both? It's somewhat big enough."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "That's-no-that's not how-works-that's not how that works-" Fern was flustered beyond belief. Was this real? No, this couldn't be. This was only something that showed up in bad fanfiction or the guiltiest fantasies they locked away out of shame and embarassment. Did they consider this that Leif might have felt too guilty to let them sleep on the floor? Yes, but it was nothing but a pipe dream. As Leif was tucking himself into bed though by the window, Fern could feel their face rapidly start to heat up as the reality of the situation continued to settle in.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "What do you mean? It's nothing crazy, we're just sharing a bed." He shrugged his shoulders, unworried. "It's just the easiest way to do things, right?"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Yeah, but-but no, the two of us in the same bed-" Fern's brain was fully overheating now. This felt so out of character for the usually embarassed, flustered Leif that they knew. Was Leif actually less socially anxious than they thought? Or were they just really comfortable around them? Either way, Fern could nearly faint at the thought of sleeping in the same bed as him. This was so clichéd, so absurd, and so embarassing that it made no sense how someone like Leif could be so calm.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Leif looked up, sitting with their back against the window. "Hm? Fern, are you alright? I, uh, sorry if this makes you uncomfortable-I dunno how these things work, honestly, as embarassing as that is to admit…"
