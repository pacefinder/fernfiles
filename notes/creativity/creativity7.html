"Wha-me?!" Fern exclaimed as they nearly sat up. "Not like, Everett or anyone else? Isn't there that one kid in your private school who's all rebellious and stuff too?"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
"Yeah, but-those people are all true to themselves, which is different. Like-Everett really wears his heart on his sleeve. I feel like you're different in that way though-like a different kind of honesty. Like maybe we're alike in how we both kind of hide away behind anxious thoughts sometimes. But I feel like you have this strong sense of justice where if you feel like something's wrong you won't stand for it."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
"I… do? I-I dunno, I would maybe agree with you. But I'm not as genuine as I seem, you know." Fern fidgeted nervously, as being seen like this both physically and emotionally made them feel a bit vulnerable. "You were right about how I hide away often-but I don't think I really show myself past that."

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
"Even if so though, I feel like… Even if you were to smile and nod, you would be boiling underneath if you saw something bad happening. And it's how we avoid getting in trouble, because blowing up constantly at people would be exhausting and attract way too much attention." Leif shuffled a bit as he tucked his arms underneath the blanket. "You're one of the few people I know who won't just take 'that's just the way things are', if that sorta makes sense. You never use the status quo to justify something that's happening-"

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
"No, no, it's okay! Sorry about that, I kinda get rambly when it's late… " Leif took a breath to collect his thoughts. "I think you look at the way things could be rather than the way things are. You don't let the world justify it's own flaws, like when people say things like 'just because' or something. You always want to see a situation where everyone can win, or where everyone can be happy… And I've sorta thought about that too with the 'way things could be', but you really, really do that."        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
"Even if you don't say it all the time, or you hide it, you believe that at your core I think. So even if you're going along with what you don't believe, it doesn't mean you genuienly believe that. And I admire that. I wanna be as hopeful as you are, as stubborn as you are for fighting for that world."        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Leif looked at Fern, eyes drifting across their body. "I think, though… When it comes to that world, the thing you try to sacrifice most is yourself. You consider it a win if everyone else is happy." Leif frowned. "But you should be happy too-I feel like you always check in with me and everything, but I don't want to leave you behind. I wanna be there for you, too." 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Leif…"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Fern grinned. "You know, in every cheesy fanfiction I read, this is when we start kissing."
