"Don't-" Fern looked into Leif's eyes, before quickly looking away. "I mean-don't-you don't have to. I'm okay like this, but if you feel uncomfortable you can look away too."

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
"I… I think I'm okay with this, too."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
"Uh, I don't mean to come off as insensitive with this question… but are you sure?" Fern fidgeted with their hair, curling it around their finger. "It's okay if you aren't, especially with your, uh, parents and all that. I was surprised too with you offering this because I feel like if you did this kinda thing and your parents knew they would kill you-or me, actually, haha…"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
Fern laughed at their grim joke, but even to them it sent a shiver down their spine just thinking about it. Leif chuckled sweetly though which eased Fern's spirits.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
"That's true, but… What have my parents got to do with this, let alone what I do? I'm not doing anything wrong here. We're just lying on the same bed, which is somewhat normal for sleepovers right? And I'm comfortable like this." Leif smiled, but his eyes seemed to wander somewhere else. "I don't wanna… fear what they might think even when they're not around. I don't wanna hear my dad yelling even when I'm not at home. I don't wanna feel like I'm disappointing my mom even when she's not looking at me. I just wanna do what I feel is right, even if I mess up."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
"Since when did you get so rebellious?" Fern teased, brushing a little bit of hair in front of Leif's face away from his eyes. The gesture was small, but when they were so close together Fern felt like their heart could have jumped out of their chest at that moment. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "I-I dunno… I guess, just… Maybe you?"
