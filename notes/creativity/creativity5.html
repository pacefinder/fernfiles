        Leif looked to the side nervously. "…a bit… I didn't wanna make it weird though, especially since it seemed so normal for sleepovers from what I heard-agh, dammit, Fern, I was holding it so well together earlier-!"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
Fern laughed, rolling over and looking at the ceiling. "Sorry, sorry! Honestly, I'm kinda relieved you're a bit anxious too. I dunno, I guess it's a bit more comforting that this is new for the both of us. Like, maybe everyone pretends it's not awkward too."        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
"Oh, have you never had a sleepover too?"
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
"Hmm…" Fern's eyes wandered among the faint gray spots on the roof before they turned to face Leif again. "Well, I have, but not for a while. Most of the ones I had were when I was younger, at other friend's houses. So having one now feels kinda funny."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
Leif chuckled a bit. "It does kinda feel funny, since it feels like we outgrew sleepovers. But I think it's fun, and I'm glad you invited me."

        There was an oddly uncomfortable but filling silence as the two of them stared at each other not knowing what to say. The both of them simply took the other in with their eyes, with only the dim yellow lamp light illuminating the both of them.
