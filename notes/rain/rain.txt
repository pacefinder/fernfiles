sometimes it'll be a rainy day, and i'll think of you. i remember the stupidest things about you, but they're starting to get hazy and i try to grab them again by looking at the handful of photos i have of you. i wish i had more. i wish i took more, i would have, if i knew everything that was going to happen. i miss you. fuck, i miss you so bad, every single day. im essentially killing myself, digging myself deeper into my own hole every time i see your smile again but i don't know what else to do. if you're gonna be stuck in my head anyways, what else can i do but at least see you even if only on my phone? sure, we text sometimes in the brief periods you have free time. but it just makes me miss you more, that i can't hear your voice right next to me. and it's not like there's even a chance i could fly over or like you're some distant online friend.

i'll never see you. i can never see you again. but god, i want to so bad.

i say it's because of the deity-or the corruption, whatever. that might just be an excuse. i don't think i'd have the courage to see you even without it. it would rip my heart in two, missing both of you.(that was oddly lyrical?) i can't win. because i don't think you would want to be around him, and i wouldn't blame you. you're probably feeling so much more hurt, both of you. but can you feel hurt for me too? can you miss me, too? can you miss having me around as much as you miss each other? i feel sick. i feel selfish. i feel like reaching through my own mouth, ripping out every horrible, horrible part of me until i'm just a shell like everyone acts like i am. i want to not be the disgusting person i am.

i just want to be missed. i just want to see you.
